It can accommodate data that embeddings from features or distances cannot, but is a more difficult problem. We propose a novel landmark-based method as a partial solution. At small to medium scales, we present a novel combination of existing methods with some new theoretical justification. For very large values of n optimizing over an entire embedding breaks down, so we propose a novel method which first embeds a subset of m {$<<$} n objects and then embeds the remaining objects independently and in parallel. We prove a distance error bound for our method in terms of m and that it has O(dn log m) time complexity, and show empirically that it is able to produce high quality embeddings in a fraction of the time needed for any published method.},

They can thereby identify and discover 'types': of behaviour, views, abilities, dispositions. The mathematical theory of tangles has its origins in the connectivity theory of graphs, which it has transformed over the past 30 years. It has recently been axiomatized in a way that makes its two deepest results applicable to a much wider range of contexts. This expository paper indicates some contexts where this difference of approach is particularly striking. But these are merely examples of such contexts: in principle, it can apply to much of the quantitative social sciences. Our aim here is twofold: to indicate just enough of the theory of tangles to show how this can work in the various different contexts, and to give plenty of different examples illustrating this.},

Instead, we assume that only a set of comparisons between objects is available, that is, statements of the form objects i and j are more similar than objects k and l.'' Such a scenario is commonly encountered in crowdsourcing applications. The focus of this work is to develop comparison-based hierarchical clustering algorithms that do not rely on the principles of ordinal embedding. We show that single and complete linkage are inherently comparison-based and we develop variants of average linkage. We provide statistical guarantees for the different methods under a planted hierarchical partition model. We also empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed approaches on several datasets.},

Existing approaches for this ``ordinal embedding'' problem require expensive optimization procedures, which cannot scale to handle increasingly larger datasets. To address this issue, we propose a landmark-based strategy, which we call Landmark Ordinal Embedding (LOE). Our approach trades off statistical efficiency for computational efficiency by exploiting the low-dimensionality of the latent embedding. We derive bounds establishing the statistical consistency of LOE under the popular Bradley- Terry-Luce noise model. Through a rigorous analysis of the computational complexity, we show that LOE is significantly more efficient than conventional ordinal embedding approaches as the number of items grows. We validate these characterizations empirically on both synthetic and real datasets. We also present a practical approach that achieves the ``best of both worlds'', by using LOE to warm-start existing methods that are more statistically efficient but computationally expensive.},

In recent years, however, crowdsourcing platforms are becoming increasingly popular means of data collection, measuring many participants at the potential cost of obtaining data of worse quality. In this paper we study whether the use of comparison-based (ordinal) data, combined with machine learning algorithms, can boost the reliability of crowdsourcing studies for psychophysics, such that they can achieve performance close to a lab experiment. To this end, we compare three setups: simulations, a psychophysics lab experiment, and the same experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. All these experiments are conducted in a comparison-based setting where participants have to answer triplet questions of the form "is object x closer to y or to z?". We then use machine learning to solve the triplet prediction problem: given a subset of triplet questions with corresponding answers, we predict the answer to the remaining questions. Considering the limitations and noise on MTurk, we find that the accuracy of triplet prediction is surprisingly close---but not equal---to our lab study.},

We propose to use ordinal embedding methods from machine learning to estimate the scaling function from the relative judgments. We review two relevant and well-known methods in psychophysics that are partially applicable in our setting: nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the method of maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS). Considering various scaling functions, we perform an extensive set of simulations to demonstrate the performance of the ordinal embedding methods. We show that in contrast to existing approaches, our ordinal embedding approach allows, first, to obtain reasonable scaling functions from comparatively few relative judgments and, second, to estimate multidimensional perceptual scales. In addition to the simulations, we analyze data from two real psychophysics experiments using ordinal embedding methods. Our results show that in the one-dimensional perceptual scale, our ordinal embedding approach works as well as MLDS, while in higher dimensions, only our ordinal embedding methods can produce a desirable scaling function. To make our methods widely accessible, we provide an R-implementation and general rules of thumb on how to use ordinal embedding in the context of psychophysics.}

In this paper we showcase the practical potential of tangles in machine learning applications. Given a collection of weak cuts (bipartitions) of any dataset, tangles provide a mechanism to aggregate these cuts such that they point in the direction of a dense structure. As a result, a cluster is softly characterized by a set of consistent pointers. This highly flexible approach can solve soft clustering problems in a variety of setups, ranging from questionnaires over community detection in graphs to clustering points in metric spaces. The output of our proposed framework is of a hierarchical nature and induces the notion of a soft dendrogram, which can be helpful to explore the cluster structure of a dataset. The computational complexity of aggregating the cuts is only linear in the number of data points and places the bottleneck on generating the cuts, for which simple and fast algorithms form a sufficient basis. The contribution of this paper is to translate the abstract mathematical literature into algorithms that can be used in machine learning. We demonstrate the power of tangles in many different use cases and provide theoretical guarantees for their performance.},

The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

We study this problem from a theoretical viewpoint, measuring cluster quality by the k-means and k-medians objectives. In terms of negative results, we show that popular top-down decision tree algorithms may lead to clusterings with arbitrarily large cost, and any clustering based on a tree with k leaves must incur an Omega(log k) approximation factor compared to the optimal clustering. On the positive side, for two means/medians, we show that a single threshold cut can achieve a constant factor approximation, and we give nearly-matching lower bounds; for general k {$>$} 2, we design an efficient algorithm that leads to an O(k) approximation to the optimal k-medians and an O(k\^2) approximation to the optimal k-means.

  abstract = {A publicly-available dataset that embodies the task-general capabilities of human perception and reasoning, and uses the similarity ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models conform to human similarity judgments. Advances in supervised learning approaches to object recognition flourished in part because of the availability of high-quality datasets and associated benchmarks. However, these benchmarks\textemdash such as ILSVRC\textemdash are relatively task-specific, focusing predominately on predicting class labels. We introduce a publicly-available dataset that embodies the task-general capabilities of human perception and reasoning. The Human Similarity Judgments extension to ImageNet (ImageNet-HSJ) is composed of a large set of human similarity judgments that supplements the existing ILSVRC validation set. The new dataset supports a range of task and performance metrics, including evaluation of unsupervised algorithms. We demonstrate two methods of assessment: using the similarity judgments directly and using a psychological embedding trained on the similarity judgments. This embedding space contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous efforts based on human judgments. We were able to scale to the full 50,000 image ILSVRC validation set through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian inference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that were most uncertain. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models conform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that the more complex models that perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human semantic judgments. In addition to the human similarity judgments, pre-trained psychological embeddings and code for inferring variational embeddings are made publicly available. ImageNet-HSJ supports the appraisal of internal representations and the development of more humanlike models.},

  abstract = {The Rashomon effect occurs when many different explanations exist for the same phenomenon. In machine learning, Leo Breiman used this term to characterize problems where many accurate-but-different models exist to describe the same data. In this work, we study how the Rashomon effect can be useful for understanding the relationship between training and test performance, and the possibility that simple-yet-accurate models exist for many problems. We consider the Rashomon set - the set of almost-equally-accurate models for a given problem - and study its properties and the types of models it could contain. We present the Rashomon ratio as a new measure related to simplicity of model classes, which is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space; the Rashomon ratio is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory. For a hierarchy of hypothesis spaces, the Rashomon ratio can help modelers to navigate the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy. In particular, we find empirically that a plot of empirical risk vs. Rashomon ratio forms a characteristic \$\textbackslash Gamma\$-shaped Rashomon curve, whose elbow seems to be a reliable model selection criterion. When the Rashomon set is large, models that are accurate - but that also have various other useful properties - can often be obtained. These models might obey various constraints such as interpretability, fairness, or monotonicity.},

Our method and theory for the first time consider issues of high communication cost, stragglers, and fault tolerance for distributed multi-task learning. The resulting method achieves significant speedups compared to alternatives in the federated setting, as we demonstrate through simulations on real-world federated datasets.},

Performance is surprisingly poor compared with discrimination of the same stimuli. Existing models assume that identification is achieved using long-term representations of absolute magnitudes. The authors propose an alternative relative judgment model (RJM) in which the elemental perceptual units are representations of the differences between current and previous stimuli. These differences are used, together with the previous feedback, to respond. Without using long-term representations of absolute magnitudes, the RJM accounts for (a) information transmission limits, (b) bowed serial position effects, and (c) sequential effects, where responses are biased toward immediately preceding stimuli but away from more distant stimuli (assimilation and contrast).},

The output is an embedding of the objects into Euclidean space (like MDS); we refer to this as the "crowd kernel." SVMs reveal that the crowd kernel captures prominent and subtle features across a number of domains, such as "is striped" among neckties and "vowel vs. consonant" among letters.},

Our first contribution is to suggest a simple new algorithm for this problem, Soft Ordinal Embed-ding. The key feature of the algorithm is that it recovers not only the ordinal constraints, but even the density structure of the underlying data set. As our second contribution we prove that in the large sample limit it is enough to know "local ordinal information" in order to perfectly reconstruct a given point configuration. This leads to our Local Ordinal Embedding algorithm, which can also be used for graph drawing.

We build upon existing work on correlation clustering, a well-known non-parametric approach to clustering, and present a novel clustering algorithm for human computation. We first define a novel variant of correlation clustering that is based on relative distance comparisons, and briefly outline an approximation algorithm for this problem. As a second contribution, we propose a more practical algorithm, which we empirically compare against existing methods from literature. Experiments with synthetic data suggest that our approach can outperform more complex methods. Also, our method efficiently finds good and intuitive clusterings from real relative distance comparison data.},

In recent years, numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. However, there does not exist a fair and thorough assessment of these embedding methods and therefore several key questions remain unanswered: Which algorithms perform better when the embedding dimension is constrained or few triplet comparisons are available? Which ones scale better with increasing sample size or dimension? In our paper, we address these questions and provide the first comprehensive and systematic empirical evaluation of existing algorithms as well as a new neural network approach. We find that simple, relatively unknown, non-convex methods consistently outperform all other algorithms, including elaborate approaches based on neural networks or landmark approaches. This finding can be explained by our insight that many of the non-convex optimization approaches do not suffer from local optima. Our comprehensive assessment is enabled by our unified library of popular embedding algorithms that leverages GPU resources and allows for fast and accurate embeddings of millions of data points.},
